PROJECT TITLE:WASTE CLASSIFICATION FOR SMART RECYCLING 
PROJECT PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Improper waste segregation leads to pollution and inefficient recycling.
To support sustainability, an image-based system can help classify waste automatically into categories like plastic, paper, metal, and organic using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
PROJECT GOAL:
Build a CNN model that can take an image of waste and classify it into the correct category, promoting smart recycling and sustainable waste management.
CONCEPTS USED:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): for image recognition.
Deep Learning: part of AI that helps computers learn from images.
Sustainability: helps reduce pollution by sorting waste properly.
